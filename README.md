Machine Learning Intern Assessment Assignment
Assignment Title : Customer Churn Prediction

Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. You
will follow a typical machine learning project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
Data:
You are provided with a dataset containing historical customer information, including customer
attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is in CSV format.
Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:



Load the provided dataset and perform initial data exploration.
Handle missing data and outliers.
Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into
training and testing sets.
2. Feature Engineering:


Generate relevant features from the dataset that can help improve the model's prediction
accuracy.
Apply feature scaling or normalization if necessary.
3. Model Building:



Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or
neural networks).
Train and validate the selected model on the training dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall,
F1-score).
4. Model Optimization:


Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its predictive performance.
Explore techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.5. Model Deployment:


Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into a production-like
environment (you can simulate this in a development environment).
Ensure the model can take new customer data as input and provide churn predictions.
Deliverables:
1. Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your code.
2. A brief report summarizing your approach, including any data preprocessing, feature
engineering, and model selection decisions.
3. Model performance metrics and visualizations.
Additional Information:


You are encouraged to use Python and relevant machine learning libraries like scikit-
learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
We expect you to demonstrate your skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering,
model building, and deployment.
Evaluation Criteria:
Your assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:






Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Feature engineering creativity and effectiveness.
Model selection and optimization.
Model deployment and integration.
Clarity and organization of your code.
Documentation and reporting of your work.
Note:
This assignment is designed to evaluate your skills and approach to a real-world machine learning
problem, aligning with the responsibilities of a Machine Learning Engineer at Sunbase. Good luck with
your project, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
